This challenge was a relatively simple one. It told you to use this [link](http://stars.chromeexperiments.com "I might help you")
and then wanted you to find out what stars are represented by the following
numbers?

`21185`, `1618`, `753`

If you zoom in to the collection of stars, you'll be able to see the certain
names of stars, followed by the numbers above. The stars were *Lalande 21185*,
*Groombridge 1618* and *HR 753*.

So the answer was **LALANDE_GROOMBRIDGE_HR**.
