The questions was: *"What can I make with just a desert and water?"* and a link
to the game 'Little Alchemy' was given. 

This link was a slight red-herring and you just needed to know what the game
did which was to combine several raw items together to get new items. Using
this principle, the number of items exponentially grow and more and more
obscure items begin to get formed. 

If you found a cheat to this principle and searched for a complete list of
Little Alchemy items, you'd then be able to search through that list to find
which items were able to be made from just a desert and water. The easiest way
to do this was to run a find on this webpage and search for 'desert', this was
relevant to only a few items and so you could easily work out which ones just
required water to be formed, manually. There was only one item that could be
formed by these two items and it also happens to be a band, hence the musical
clue. 

Therefore the answer is **OASIS**.
