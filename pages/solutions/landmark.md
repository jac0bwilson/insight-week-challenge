You were given one line of numbers and letter called a string. 

`34322e3134323339362c202d3130322e383538373831`

It was difficult to notice but it only contains 4 letters 'e', 'c', 'd' and
another 'e'. These are within the the first 6 letters of the alphabet and used
within the Hexadecimal number set. Therefore the string above is in
hexadecimal, if you decode it from hex, you get the following ...

`42.142396, -102.858781`

This looks a lot like a longitude and latitude. If you put those in Google Maps
and then go to street view and have a look around, you soon realise you are in
a place called 'Carhenge'. 

Therefore the answer is **CARHENGE**.
