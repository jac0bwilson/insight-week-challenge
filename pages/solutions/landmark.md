You were given one line of numbers and letters called a string. 

`34322e3134323339362c202d3130322e383538373831`

It was difficult to notice but it only contains 4 letters `e`, `c`, `d` and another `e`. These are within the the first 6 letters of the alphabet and all used within the hexadecimal number set. 

The hexadecimal numbers translate a number set into base 16 rather than our normal number system (decimal) which is base 10. Unlike the common way of representing numbers with ten symbols, it uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values zero to nine, and "A"–"F" to represent values ten to fifteen.

Therefore the string above is in hexadecimal, if you decode it from hex using an online decoder, you get the following ...

`42.142396, -102.858781`

which looks a lot like a longitude and latitude. If you put those in Google Maps and then go to street view and have a look around, you soon realise you are in a place called 'Carhenge'. 

Therefore the answer is **CARHENGE**.
