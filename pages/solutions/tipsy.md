[dialfreq]: /assets/img/tilt.png "Look from a different perspective"

All you had to do was tilt your device and read the phrase from a low angle,
try tilting and turning your phone until you can see it. When you tilt it one
way it says *'You look like an idiot right now'* and the other way says
*'Hello World'*. If you tilt your device forwards so that it is horizontal and
you look at it level on you'll be able to see the phrase.

The phrase and answer written in the diagram is **HELLO_WORLD**.

The phrase *'hello world'* is significant as many programmers try to
familiarise themselves with a new programming language by writing a program
which prints out that phrase.
