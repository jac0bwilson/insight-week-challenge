All you had to do was tilt your device and read the phrase from a low angle, try tilting and turning your phone until you can see it. When you tilt it one way it says `You look like an idiot right now` and the other way says `Hello world`, if you tilt your device forwards so that it is horizontal and you look at it level on you'll be able to see the phrase.

The phrase and answer written in the diagram is **HELLO_WORLD**
