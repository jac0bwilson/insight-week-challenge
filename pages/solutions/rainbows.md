These were the codes that were given to you in the question...

| Code | Value 1    | Value 2    | Value 3   | Value 4    | Value 5    | Value 6    |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1:   | 4285F4     | DB4437     | F4B400    | 4285F4     | 0F9D58     | DB4437     |
| 2:   | 66 133 244 | 219 68 55  | 244 180 0 | 66 133 244 | 15 157 88  | 219 68 55  |
| 3:   | 88 50 0 0  | 0 78 85 12 | 0 20 90 0 | 88 50 0 0  | 82 0 67 11 | 0 78 85 12 |
| 4:   | PMS 660 C  | PMS 7619 C | PMS 123 C | PMS 660 C  | PMS 7724 C | PMS 7619 C |

The question asked what company they all point to.

Code one is a hexadecimal number and represent colours.
Code two is a RGB number and represent red, green and blue values.
Code 3 is a CYMK code, standing for cyan, yellow, magenta and black.
Code 4 is the Pantone colour code. 

These all therefore relate to colours, the only thing to do now is work out which company has this colour scheme. Each value represens a letter in the company name which is coloured by the corresponding code, the company will be obvious when you spot it.

It is in fact 'GOOGLE'
