These were the codes that were given to you in the question...

| Code | Value 1    | Value 2    | Value 3   | Value 4    | Value 5    | Value 6    |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1:   | 4285F4     | DB4437     | F4B400    | 4285F4     | 0F9D58     | DB4437     |
| 2:   | 66 133 244 | 219 68 55  | 244 180 0 | 66 133 244 | 15 157 88  | 219 68 55  |
| 3:   | 88 50 0 0  | 0 78 85 12 | 0 20 90 0 | 88 50 0 0  | 82 0 67 11 | 0 78 85 12 |
| 4:   | PMS 660 C  | PMS 7619 C | PMS 123 C | PMS 660 C  | PMS 7724 C | PMS 7619 C |

The question asked what company they all point to.

All of the codes are methods of representing colours:

* Code 1 is a set of hexadecimal numbers.
* Code 2 is a set of RGB (red, green, blue) numbers.
* Code 3 is a set of CYMK (cyan, yellow, magenta and black) codes.
* Code 4 is a set of Pantone colour code.

The only thing to do now is work out which company these colours relate to.
Each value represents a letter in the company logo which is coloured by the
corresponding code, the company will be obvious when you spot it.

It is in fact **GOOGLE**.
