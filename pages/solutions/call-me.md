To work out the pin code dialed using the frequency diagram, you first need to
understand Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) as depicted below.

Each input on a keypad has a different tone to be recognised. Each input has
two tones, hence the 'Dual Tone', where these are portrayed as a column and a
row in the diagram below and two yellow lines (showing the power) in each
column in the frequency diagram. The frequencies of the tones are written
below.

If you looked through the frequency diagram, you should be able to work out
the four numbers by the differences in frequencies.

The answer was **FOUR_FIVE_ZERO_SEVEN**.
