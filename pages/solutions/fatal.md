This challenge required just a little bit of searching to work out what the
information meant. You were given the following information and told to find
out the fatality.

`NARSARSUAQ, W-87`

Initially, you'd need to find out what the words meant, by searching to find
out the following:

* *Narsarsuaq* is a settlement in Greenland.
* *W-87* is a type of bomb.

If you opened the
[link](https://outrider.org/nuclear-weapons/interactive/bomb-blast/ "I Might Help You")
and typed in *Narsarsuaq* as the location and chose the *W-87* bomb, the linked
website would have given you the fatality count of **161**.

Translate this to words to get you answer, **ONE_SIX_ONE**.
