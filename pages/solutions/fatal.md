This challenge required just a little bit of searching to work out what the
information meant. You were given the following information and told to find
out the fatality.

`NARSARSUAQ, W-87`

If you opened the [link](https://outrider.org/nuclear-weapons/interactive/bomb-blast/ "I Might Help You")
and typed in *Narsarsuaq* which is a settlement in Greenland and then chose
the bomb *W-87*, the linked website would have given you the fatality count of
161.

Translate this to words to get you answer, **ONE_SIX_ONE**.
