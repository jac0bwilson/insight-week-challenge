This was a little trickier. The given cipher, `cmenfyzgsvtfzyngsvaemc`, was a
difficult one to crack, so the hint here was very helpful. The code was to be
shifted by 27 after doing some simple maths from the hint. If you found an
online decoder, and applied ROT27 to it, you'd get the following code...

`bldmexyfruseyxmfruzdlb`

Once you open the link [here](https://ruwix.com/online-puzzle-simulators/ "I Might Help You")
and type the code above into the website, the Rubik's cube rotates in the
corresponding directions. Once you have applied these moves, the colours that
make up the top corner (nearest to the camera) are **YELLOW_GREEN_RED**. This
is the answer to this challenge.
