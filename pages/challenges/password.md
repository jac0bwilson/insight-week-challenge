I managed to set my password to be '`password`', but then the system changed
their rules. It is now impossible to get the system to accept my password.

As everyone should know, having a password of simply '`password`' is extremely
insecure, so the people in charge of the IT system decided to add the word to a
list of banned words for including in passwords.

You'll find the answer to this challenge if you manage to log into my account
by getting around this filtering system!
