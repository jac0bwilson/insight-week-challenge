I wrote down the answer on this page, but somehow it seems to have been blocked
from view?

<svg width="500" height="50">
    <text x="100" y="15" fill="black">TOLD_YOU_IT_WAS_HERE</text>
    <rect width="250" height="20" style="fill:rgb(0,0,0);stroke-with=3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" x="100" y="0" />
</svg>

If you can find it, submit the string as the answer to this challenge.
