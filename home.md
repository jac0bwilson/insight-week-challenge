We have created a series of technology challenges for you to complete - with
difficulties from beginner-friendly to advanced. 

We know not everyone signed up for the Digital stream for the Insight Week, but
please get involved and see what you can do!

Every challenge is on its own page, and each page will have an input box that
you can use to check your answer. Using this input box to check your answer is
not enough to earn any points for the challenge. Once you are done with all of
the challenges, please submit your final answers on the provided [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdY8CXp1X3GdxRZ8Y8O1Jx5MhLP4eAHbUx_IoBjEGxIM2LD6w/viewform)
and they will be marked.

**The challenges page contains specific details of what the solutions will look
like.**

Once the submission deadline has passed, we will be uploading all of the
solutions to the challenges (along with explanations of how to solve them). So
make sure you check back here!
